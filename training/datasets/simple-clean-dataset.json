We will specifically order these in for you as per the finish, size or colour you have selected at the point of order. Delivery times vary by product and design partner, so please find the relevant lead time information on the product page. Once orders have been received into our warehouse we will arrange final delivery with you. We offer a simple and competitive delivery rate: </p>\n<p> Please note, Highlands and Islands deliveries are not included in the UK charges above and may be charged an additional fee so please check prices with us prior to ordering.

Overseas delivery We can deliver overseas and will need to offer a quotation. Please contact us for a quote, with the details of your order and its destination hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk 020 8305 7265. Delivery Partners We use Royal Mail, UPS or APC to deliver accessories, small furniture & lighting. Delivery is Monday to Friday, we will notify you once the item has been sent and provide tracking details where applicable. For large furniture orders such as sofas, we use a specialist furniture home delivery team, who are experts in handling furniture to make sure your delivery goes as smoothly as possible. This service is a 'white glove' service and includes the following: Confirmation of your two-hour delivery window the working day before your agreed delivery date An estimated time of arrival on the day of delivery (this is a guide not a guarantee due to traffic and possible difficulties in earlier deliveries which are out of our control) Two man delivery team Unpack and position the furniture in the room of your choice Remove and recycle packaging We ask that you check the dimensions at the delivery address for access (including doors, corridors and stairs) as well as the area of intended use, before you order to ensure that the product is the right size for you and to enable us to deliver your order successfully. You must provide a clear route to the room of choice removing any obstacles from the exterior and communal areas. Goods that fail to fit into your property at the point of delivery are your responsibility as we have no control over this. Please also advise us of any parking restrictions, red routes or width restrictions ahead of the delivery. Access Checks If you are looking to buy a sofa but concerned that it might not fit through your doorway or stairwell then it's worth considering using our access check service. For an additional fee a trained member of our team will visit your home to measure up, giving you piece of mind before you buy. Get in touch to find out pricing and further details. Removal of existing furniture As part of the white glove service we can also remove your old furniture for an extra fee, which must be arranged with us prior to delivery. We reserve the right to refuse collection of unhygienic furniture for health and safety reasons. Please get in touch to find out further details. RETURNS We offer a no quibble returns policy* - so you are fully entitled to a refund within 14 working days of delivery. *except for the products described below referred to as made-to-order or those in our OutletClearance collection. Please get in touch with us if you wish to return an item and we will advise how best to proceed hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk 020 8305 7265. We ask that the product you return is in new, unused, condition with all the original packaging and product tags still attached. For small accessory items being returned by post or courier, we advise you use an insured, signed for service in case the parcel fails to reach us.

Our wood is select-logged and low waste. Fully recyclable and biodegradable packaging. </div>\n<h2> FSC\u00ae Certified Timber </h2>\n<p> FSC\u00ae certified, which stands for the Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae, is a certification system co-founded by WWF (World Wildlife Fund). An FSC\u00ae chain of custody means that the timber comes from a forest that is responsibly managed. Trees in the certified forests are grown and harvested according to a strict set of guidelines that benefit the environment. All of the wood we use at Totem Road comes with a fully documented chain of custody of the journey from the forest to the furniture that ends up in your homes. </p>\n<h2> 100% Sustainable Oak </h2>\n<p> Not only is oak incredibly durable and long-lasting, each piece is unique in its grain and finish. Our wood is select-logged to support regeneration, biodiversity and the protection of native fauna. Every last piece of wood is utilised in our manufacturing and as a result, we have some of the lowest wastage percentages in the industry. </p>\n<h2> Conscious Packaging </h2>\n<p> Our commitment to sustainability is seen throughout the entire process from factory to furniture, including how our pieces arrive to your homes. Totem Road is securely packed in fully recyclable and biodegradable packaging and won\u2019t contribute to landfill or harm the environment. It comes at a cost to us, but cheaper petrochemical-based packaging such as polystyrene, has a large manufacturing footprint, contains toxic substances and has little to no biodegradability.

Dimensions: 110 cm width x 65 cm depth x 87 cm height Materials: Metal, moulded foam, fabric </p>\n<div> Product Sheet Care Instructions 3D-files </div>\n<p> \u201cA chair is a chair, is a chair, is a chair... but a seat does not necessarily have to be a chair. It can be anything as long as it is ergonomically correct. A seat could even be a small and soft Pony on which you can ride or sit sideways. Pony looks like a child\u2019s oversized toy, but its dimensions are suited to adults. We are all big kids, of course.\u201d In 1972 the Aarnios lived in Tontunm\u00e4ki, where Eero utilized their garage as his work space. Although his previous pieces had already possessed uniqueness and characteristics, Eero describes Pony as his first very unusual design. He thought about chairs. One can sit almost anywhere. A seat doesn\u2019t even have to be a chair or a sofa. One can sit on the stairs, on a rock, on a tree stump, on a horse, on a pony\u2026 He decided to design a soft animal figure, which you could sit on, like riding a horse. In 1973 the first sketch of the Pony was sent to Asko Furniture company, who was the main producer of Eero Aarnio\u2019s designs. They completed the basic form for the seat and sent it by bus to Puumala, where Eero continued developing the prototype at the Aarnio family\u2019s summer cottage. Eero thought the first mold was decent but needed enhancing. In the country side, there was plenty of space to work, and since the body was made of polystyrene, he didn\u2019t mind getting his hands and surroundings all over it. Eero bought some modeling clay and worked further with the body. After the basic form was finished, he painted the first Pony white. From the start Eero knew the Pony needed upholstering. The process for the upholsterer is extremely challenging and difficult, requiring rare talent in hand crafting. As a result, one can only admire the magnificent seaming, intertwining together with the form of the body and flexibility of the fabric. However, some Ponys out there do not have their \u2018furs\u2019. Batches has been produced of concrete to serve as road blocks. Ponys made of concrete are not easily moved around, since they weigh as much as 250kg. Eero Aarnio\u2019s Pony is no regular chair. The designer himself prefers to rather call it a seat. Eero designed the Pony first and foremost to provide a comfortable form. The size came out of ergonomics, it is the perfect height for back and feet to rest. One can ride it or sit sideways on it. Eero initially designed the smaller size for children, however, the young have always been as keen on to climb on the larger Pony. It looks like a child\u2019s oversized toy, even though the dimensions are designed for adults. \u201cWe are all big kids, of course\u201d, says Eero Aarnio. Pony is often referred to as intriguing the inner child in adults. Eero\u2019s design aesthetics have a certain playfulness and humor, which have been very salient in his creativity and thinking process. Eero believes certain pieces should have a certain personality, one that suits them perfectly. For example, color is a key part of the message and a way of communicating for Eero. For the Pony, Eero prefers the colors green and white. Although, speaking from experience, for a family with children, white can be quite sensitive\u2026 </p>\n<p> Unioninkatu 26, 00130 Helsinki Mon-Wed 10-16.00 +358 40 559 0089 Eero's Story </p>\n<li> Shop The Archive Eero's Story Terms of Service Refund policy </li>\n<p> Footer Contact </p>\n<li> Contact Shipping & Returns Wholesale & Projects Retailers </li>\n<p> Footer Legal </p>\n<li> Privacy Policy Terms of Service Q&A </li>\n<div> Subscribe to our newsletter </div>\n<p> \u00a9 2024 Eero Aarnio Originals. </p>\n<h2> Search </h2>\n<div> English </div>\n<li> Suomi English </li>\n<div> English </div>\n<li> Suomi English </li>\n<img> Visa </img>\n<img> Mastercard </img>\n<img> American Express </img>\n<img> OP </img>\n<img> Nordea </img>\n<img> Klarna </img>\n<img> Danske Bank </img>\n<img> S-pankki </img>\n<img> S\u00e4\u00e4st\u00f6pankki </img>\n<img> Aktia </img>\n<img> Pop Pankki </img>\n<img> Oma SP </img>\n<img> Handelsbanken </img>\n<img> Alandsbanken </img>\n<img> Pivo </img>\n<img> Mobilepay </img>\n<img> Siirto </img>",

Originally conceived by Swedish based South Korean designer Jay Design in 2012, this beautiful ethereal piece seems to defy the law of gravity. The Chieut has attracted the praise of leading architectural luminaries such as the Zaha Hadid Architects and was the recipient of the prestigious Golden A' Design Award in 2017. The Chieut table is entirely handcrafted in Italy by design atelier Minimaproject with the finest materials in a limited edition of 200 pieces to guarantee the uniqueness of each piece. Both body and legs can be ordered in a number of powder coating colour finishes to obtain interesting cromatic combinations. Small imperfections might be present-evidence that our pieces are unique and not mass produced.

For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftsmanship, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality. In recent years, Goodrum\u2019s work has been awarded a host of design accolades including the NGV Rigg Prize, Vogue x Alessi Design Prize, Indesign Luminary Award and the Idea Awards Editor\u2019s Medal. He has also been commissioned to design pieces for several global luxury brands including Veuve Clicquot, Alessi and Cappellini. </p>\n<h2> Inspiration </h2>\n<h3> Hee Welling x HAY Designer talks.

A Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed. Crafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda. The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component. This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations! Country of Origin: India Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below: </p>\n<li> Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth; Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately; To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months. Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer. Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heatingcooling vents. Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur. Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting. </li>\n<p> Click + Collect Select Click + Collect at checkout.

Regular vacuuming is recommended without the use of beater bars to avoid threads being pulled. Spills should be absorbed with a dry cloth, then spot cleaned with mild soap and water. It\u2019s normal for loose ends to show up from time to time with any area rug, however it\u2019s important to snip them with a scissor immediately - pulling on loose ends by hand is harmful to the strength of your rug. Rug tolerances can vary by +- 3 inches in relation to the advertised size. A non-skid pad is recommended to prevent slippage. Since rugs are rolled for shipping, occasionally they may crease during transit. All creases will disappear within 2 weeks after the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling will help flatten out creases promptly.

With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back. Where cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring.\u200b Where castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard. Where legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard. All of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate. The price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know. Fabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description. For patterns, and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on fabric quantity. </p>\n<h3> YOU MAY ALSO LIKE </h3>\n<h2> The Ilchester Armchair Todhunter Earle x Lorfords Contemporary </h2>\n<div> \u00a34,650 </div>\n<h2> The Cavendish Armchair Todhunter Earle x Lorfords Contemporary </h2>\n<div> \u00a35,160 </div>\n<h2> The Kingston Armchair </h2>\n<div> \u00a35,640 </div>\n<h2> The Kingston Armchair loose cover ruffled skirt </h2>\n<div> \u00a36,900 </div>\n<h3> RECENTLY VIEWED </h3>\n<h2> ABOUT </h2>\n<p> Traditionally constructed and upholstered furniture, handmade in our Cotswold studio.

We highly recommend placing an order to ensure you secure in stock items and also to secure stock from the next shipment. What we can guarantee, is a personalised service, where we communicate lead times and secure stock promptly when ordered. We also provide a full refund within the week of purchase for any items that have a longer lead time than expected. Please read the Important Lead Times message below for more information on our stock levels. We hope you enjoy shopping with us! </p>\n<div> Sale Sold Out </div>\n<div> Tax included.

Give the gift of choice with a Cranmore Home & Co. Gift Card. All gift cards are valid for three years from purchase. If you would like a different amount, please contact us and we can arrange this for you. Our gift cards are provided as electronic gift cards, if you would like one mailed to you please let us know. Please note that the email address you enter whilst ordering is the email we will use for confirmation of the order and invoice. For us to send the gift card directly to your recipient with a personal note, please add the email address and personal note at check out in the \"note for order\" section. Any questions please contact us. Lead Times May Apply - Stock Availability: As we are an online only store all of our furniture items are delivered directly from our amazing brand partners. We work very closely with them to understand stock availability, but we also don\u2019t like to disappoint our customers if it is out of stock or if there is a lead time as stock levels change frequently. Therefore if an item has a \"lead times may apply' message this means they may be in stock or have a lead time of 4 - 12 weeks, it just means we need to double check stock availability as they are super popular. Feel free however to place an order now as we also guarantee a full refund (within the week of purchase), if we contact you to advise the item is out of stock andor lead times are longer than expected. Pre-Orders: We do however highly recommend placing a pre-order as items can sell out prior to shipments arriving, and this will ensure you receive your piece in the next shipment. If you would like estimated lead times, shipping quotes or any other information please try the instant chat or click on the Get In Touch button and we will get back to you as soon as possible. We can arrange a 50% deposit for all pre-order items, with balance due prior to delivery. Lead Times: Cranmore Home & Co quote an approximate lead time for the receipt of any orders based on information provided by their partner suppliers at time of purchase. Circumstances beyond our control, may cause disruptions and lead to a delay in your order being delivered on quoted lead times once an order is placed. We will keep you as up to date as possible on any changes to estimated lead times. Delivery: What we can promise is that we will ship all in-stock products from our Perth warehouse within 3 business days and in the case of bespoke or out-of-stock products, customers will be emailed as soon as possible with an estimated shipping date. As we are an online business and many of our larger items are delivered directly from our suppliers, in this case we endeavour to ensure that our suppliers dispatch in-stock items within 5-10 business days. Delivery all depends on where it is coming from and where you live. We generally allow 7-14 days most metro areas and for many country locations, WA, NT & Tasmania please allow 2-3 weeks. NOTE: For pre-orders from suppliers with stock coming from international manufacturers please keep in mind, the current worldwide increase in demand and restrictions for international ocean freight container exports. This is affecting supply chains extensively and sometimes lead time extensions are out of our control. Shipping: All items have a flat fee based on weight, dimensions and delivery location. This cost ranges from $9.95 - $250 for metro areas throughout Australia and this will be applied at checkout if required. For regional areas throughout Australia or for some super heavybulkyfragile items you may incur an additional fee, this will be advised after checkout, prior to dispatch if required. If you would like a quote tailored for your order prior to check out please contact us . Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available. Orders over $2500 are eligible for free shipping to metro cities (exc TAS & NT). For all orders over $2500 that fall within regional postcodes they will incur an additional delivery charge invoiced after order. Please contact us for a quote prior to order if you would like this confirmed. PLEASE NOTE: Delivery is to your post box or front door only. If you require white glove service of delivery, placement of item and removal of packaging please contact us to arrange. Additional costs will be incurred.

Deliveries are ONLY door to door and not brought into the premise unless stated otherwise. Please note that rubbish removal, assembly, placement or unpacking of goods are not included in your shipping quote unless stated otherwise. </p>\n<li> Contactless Click & Collect \ufeffavailable in our Camberwell Showroom (Victoria) for ALL items, free. Free Delivery for specific collections only, such as Ethnicraft. Flat Rates: We offer the following flat shipping rates: $15 for all homewares and smaller items, $70 for all framed prints, canvases, mirrors and larger pieces </li>\n<p> PLEASE NOTE THIS IS FOR FULL PRICE ITEMS ONLY. For sale items, we will contact you directly and provide a quote at competitive prices, however this only applies to metro areas within Australia. We want to ensure your goods arrive safely and with the least chance of damage, so in most cases we will use specialised furniture couriers which may come at a higher price. If for any reason you cannot be present to accept delivery or if you wish for goods to be left in a safe place unattended, you must clearly make note of this when placing your order. Note: Authority to leave goods unattended will void all transit insurance claims. The Banyan Tree is not liable for theft, damages or loss resulting from your goods being left unattended. *In the occurrence of a faulty item please report it to us within 48 hours of receiving the item. Pick up from our Camberwell Showroom is always an option, and it\u2019s free! Customer pickups on large pieces are done so at the bearer's responsibility and damage claims will not be accepted. Lead times can vary depending on the item, from as little as 1 week or as long as 16 weeks depending on manufacturing and shipping times. An order confirmation will be sent to your email immediately after you place your order, and you will be further advised within 2-5 business days on an estimated time of arrival for your item(s). We will strive to deliver your items within the specified timeframe, however please note that lead times are an estimate only and they may change due to circumstances beyond our control. </p>\n<li> Product images are for illustration purposes only and may differ from the actual product. You should expect colour, grain and other natural imperfections and variations on natural timber pieces, which is what gives them a unique charm. These will not be considered damaged pieces. It is not possible to request a certain colour as all pieces come in their own individual colour and finish. No two pieces will ever be the same. With solid timber pieces, we can never guarantee 100% that splitcracks will not occur. </li>\n<div> Oak Care & Maintenance - Teak Care & Maintenance </div>\n<p> We hope you love your Banyan Tree purchase, however, we understand if you change your mind when it arrives or if the piece doesn't quite fit as you hoped!

Unfortunately, there is no refund, exchange, or cancellation available on custom, made to order and special order items.

If you have ordered a larger piece of furniture, such as chests of drawers or console tables, these require very careful packaging in crates to ensure your delicate inlay furniture will not be damaged in transit. Please check our Care & Unpacking page for details on the best way to open the furniture or homewares crate. 2 people are required. The Standard Delivery service includes a crate, ground floor delivery - you are provided with a tracking number (with a standard courier delivery team), and your delivery will be taken to your door. For front doors that are accessed via stairs, your delivery will be taken to the ground floor only and not up any stairs. We recommend that, if possible, you have someone else available to assist you with taking the items inside your home, unpack and position your pieces in your home. Our Premium Furniture Delivery ($179), which is only available to metro Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane & Gold Coast service includes a 2-man delivery to your home (with items arriving un-crated and in bubble wrap and foam). For all other areas outside these metro delivery locations, ground floor delivery is included in crates (with a standard courier delivery team and tracking number), and your delivery will be taken to your door. For front doors that are accessed via stairs, your delivery will be taken to the ground floor only and not up any stairs. We recommend that, if possible, you have someone else available to assist you with taking the items inside your home, unpack and position your pieces in your home. If you do require your piece to be taken into your home and upstairs, please kindly contact us to arrange further options and we will happily arrange this with you at a cost. We pride ourselves in offering high quality pieces at reasonable pricing, so that more customers can experience the feeling of beautiful inlay pieces being in their homes. If there are any further services required for delivery, please feel free to contact us at any time prior to the delivery of your inlay pieces and we will happily assist with options at your cost. How long will it take for my order to arrive? All delivery timeframes are listed on each product page on our website. If your item is in stock (quantity of 1+ on our website), your piece will be dispatched within 2 weeks. In usual times, if your item is not in stock currently or is on the way, you could receive your items within 2-14 weeks however with these new delays we're experiencing since the beginning of Covid-19, we expect you to receive your items within 2-18 weeks. As mentioned on our product pages, please kindly contact us if you would like to check availability, or how far your desired pieces is from arriving into our Melbourne or Sydney warehouse. Our aim is to deliver the best possible service to our lovely customers, and we will ensure to keep all customers updated on the status of purchased items. In order for a smooth delivery process, please provide a suitable delivery address and contact number where deliveries can be made during business hours (Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm). We will not post to PO post office addresses. If we foresee any delays, you will be notified via email or phone. Can I give my authority to leave the items at the time of delivery? If you wish to provide Mahlia\u2019s carriers with the authority to leave your items when being delivered, please provide any authority to leave delivery instructions during the order checkout process. This will give the carriers the authority for your items to be left at the front door or another safe spot. Please note that we do not take any responsibility for loss or damage of your items in which we have been given an authority to leave. We recommend you track your items where necessary to avoid this. If you have given the authority to leave your items, a signature is not required. What if I missed my delivery, or the carrier was given limited delivery access? If a delivery is missed, you may be required to arrange re-delivery that takes additional time and may incur an additional cost (with the carrier). For smaller deliveries, if your delivery is missed, a card will be left in your letterbox to arrange a pick-up or redelivery. If there is difficult or restricted access to the delivery address, such as a high-rise apartment block or up and down stairs, please notify us at the time of purchase. Where this may occur, there may be additional shipping charges applied to your order. Please give clear instructions for delivery at checkout when purchasing items. All orders require a signature when delivered. If you have given the authority to leave your items, a signature is not required. Do you ship internationally?

We will not be liable at all for any loss or damage as a result of a late delivery of your order with us. Inlay Handmade Pieces As with all things made by hand, these pieces are all unique and small flaws may be present, which adds to the intrinsic character and beauty of each piece. Care Instructions \u200bTo clean your bone inlay or mother of pearl inlay furniture, please wipe with a slightly damp cloth. After some time of owning your inlay piece, if the shine comes off slightly then please apply a small amount of coconut oil and white wax and clean it with a dry cloth. Bone and mother of pearl inlay furniture has a porous surface, so items in high-use situations - such as coffee tables - should be sealed prior to use. Grout or polyurethane sealant (available from any hardware store) is suitable for this - example: https:www.bunnings.com.aucabot-s-500ml-satin-water-based-cabothane-clear-polyurethane-varnish_p1522368 Whilst this sealant is clear, when you are sealing your piece, we recommend using a very soft cloth in a circular motion (rather than a paint brush) in order to avoid any potential brush strokes left on your piece. Please do not use regular cleaning products (surface cleaners, glass cleaners) to care for bone inlay. They are very harsh to use on inlay pieces. If your piece is under direct and constant sunlight, the bone pieces may have the potential to turn a slightly yellow tone over time, and little exposure to sunlight can be useful to help them stay light for a longer duration. Please be careful that you don't put your inlay piece under extreme heat or directly under the sun. If your inlay products may be used often (tray, drawers for example), the bone pieces may fall from edges during the use. The wood and bone both are naturally contracting and expanding materials but not at the same pace, so during seasonweather change this could happen. Please use all-fix or super glue available locally to easily fix yourself if this may happen. For our vase products, we would recommend covering your vase base prior to using, as these vases are not 100% waterproof. Unpacking Inlay products are delicately handmade and heavy in weight, which is why our products are very carefully bubble wrapped and then packaged and bolted carefully within a crate. During the transit and customs process, our products can be moved around numerous times, and hence it is safe to package with extra precaution to eliminate any damage. When the larger furniture crate arrives at your home, you will require two tools to open the crate. This includes a crow bar and hammer, or as a third additional option you can use a cordless drill with Phillips head attachment (or a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the screws is a perfectly fine alternative). Here is a video displaying a simple way to open your crate: https:youtu.bec_73cP5dFWM </p>\n<li> About Mahlia Interiors Get in Contact Shipping and Returns Terms and Conditions Care and Unpacking </li>\n<li> Facebook Pinterest Instagram Email </li>\n<p> Payment Plans Gift Vouchers Afterpay </p>\n<p> info@mahliainteriors.com.au Copyright \u00a9 2024 Mahlia Interiors .

For full information and tips on this visit HERE. Stained wood can be easily maintained with Furniture Wax, which enhances the natural beauty of the wood and nourishes and protects the piece. Dust wood with a soft, dry cloth. Do not use harsh care products that contain ammonia or silicone as this will cut through the finish over time and damage your piece. Use coasters, trivets and felt pads under objects to protect the finish of your piece. Never place hot dishes on surfaces - the use of felt-backed table mats is recommended. Spills should be removed immediately with a cloth. Always avoid exposure to direct sunlight or heat as this can cause cracking and potential fading; a minimum of 12 inches clearance from heat sources is advised. Do not drag piece across the floor as this will cause damage or weaken joints. Dropping furniture onto corners or feet will cause damage. Toys, buckles and heels will scratch furnishings\u2014prevent these items from touching your piece when possible.

For international shipping details click here. Most furniture takes around 6-8 weeks to be ready to send. We will contact you when it's ready so that we can arrange a convenient delivery day. Large items will be delivered using a courier service who can bring it in to a room of choice. Very large, heavy items will be delivered by a 2-person courier team if this service is available to your postcode. Courier delivery unfortunately isn't available to Northern Ireland, some remote postcodes in Wales, Scotland and England or any offshore addresses. For areas not covered by our courier we can package your order on a pallet and ship it with a parcel service. This will incur a surcharge starting at \u00a340 for smaller furniture items. This will be automatically calculated at checkout for Northern Ireland. Please call or send us a message here if you want to discuss delivery options to your postcode. Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple wooden sections). We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes. We can also arrange assembly and removal of packaging using a white glove service that will do all the heavy lifting for you.

It transformed his experience and gave him the rest he needed to travel through the dense rainforest, and avoid being bitten by the many critters that roamed the forest floors. Returning to Germany he began to sell hammocks to his friends and family. Eventually, demand grew and now Amazonas is recognised as one of the best manufacturers of hammocks in the world with factories in South America and around Europe. All our hammocks are now made by skilled experts using only the best materials, which is why we are the only hammock manufacturer to carry the GS Quality and TUV Safety marks, which recognise the exceptional safety and quality of what we do. </div>\n<div> Denim Hammock Hamaca Regular price </div>\n<div> Sale price \u00a3109.10 </div>\n<p> Chic, strong and efficient, the Denim Hammock looks fabulous, durable and is superbly comfortable. We class it as a Large hammock, but at 1.45 meters wide it can easily accommodate 2 adults. The Denim Hammock is made as part of a women's co-operative in El Salvador, doing some good in a sustainable way. Soft and comfortable, it's handy built-in pocket gives you the ability to safely store whatever you desire. The Denim Hammock is a lovely colourful addition to your garden furniture.

Our gift cards have no additional processing fees. </p>\n<p> At Oak For Less\u00ae furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders. Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana. Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others. We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made. Since lead times can vary, we give an estimated range. These lead times are APPROXIMATE, they are NOT EXACT. Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders andor shippers. These situations are beyond our control. By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our best estimate. When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it. Current estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix. For example, item FD-3051T has an \"FD-\" at the beginning of its item #. On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks. So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks. Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it. If your delivery location is outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements. Also, if the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time. </p>\n<p> If you don't see the prefix of your item # here, please call us at 480-962-9930 to ask about the current production time. Need to expedite your order? We're here to help. Call 480-962-9930 and we'll let you know if it is possible to get your order sooner. A few builders offer expediting for an extra charge. Good news! We now offer nation-wide delivery for most products (we have shipped all over the U.S. We do not currently have a shipper to do Alaska nor Hawaii, and do not have international shipping (sorry!). We work with different shippers and they each have their own designated delivery areas of the U.S. - some areas may not be available, so please contact us to inquire about delivery to your area. The shopping cart will automatically calculate the type of delivery depending on the item(s) and delivery location. Or, if you would like a delivery quote, please email us at info@oakforless.com or call our store at 480-962-9930 and include the items that you are interested in as well as the delivery city, state, and zip code and we will get you a delivery quote. Delivery services are made by experienced independent contractors. Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor. Customers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled. Delivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audiovideo components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra. With any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallwaystight turnslow ceilingsis asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery. Regardless if the furniture fits into the room of choice or does not, the customer is still responsible for paying the delivery fee, it is not refundable. If the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time. White Glove Style Blanket Wrap delivery (states outside of Arizona): White Glove Style Blanket Wrap delivery starts at $395 and goes up depending on the item(s) and delivery area. To be sure of the delivery cost for your area, please contact our store and ask for a precise delivery quote. This delivery includes bringing the item(s) inside and putting them in the first dry area or depending on the shipper for your area, into the room of choice (1st floor only). If your delivery requires stairs or steps or an elevator, we need to know in advance because some shippers will not do stairs. Stairs or elevators may or may not require an additional charge, it all depends upon which shipper it is. If you order a platform bed, White Glove Style Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, and also includes up to 30 minutes of assembling the platform bed. Please note that White Glove Style Blanket Wrap delivery does NOT include attaching or reversing hardware or installing and arranging adjustable shelves inside of a bookcase or cabinet as this can be time consuming. This is a one or two person delivery. An adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition. Basic delivery (within Arizona only): Basic delivery covers areas within Arizona only. Basic delivery within Arizona starts at $95 and goes up depending on the item(s), if set up is needed, and the delivery area. Basic delivery includes the following: Placement inside the home - first floor, no stairs. This is usually a one-person delivery - the customer may be asked to assist the driver. The item may come blanket-wrapped or in a carton, depending on the builder. This delivery does not include unpacking, debris removal, assembly, nor set up. For delivery upstairs or downstairs or if you need set-up, please contact our store at 480-962-9930 to ask for those deliveryset-up costs. An adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition. </p>\n<div> You may also like Gift Card from $50 from $50 Recently viewed Shop </div>\n<li> Bedroom Dining Living Room Office Bookcases Accessories Outdoor Clearance Amish furniture FINANCING </li>\n<div> Resources </div>\n<li> Search Contact us Locations About us Shipping Delivery Terms & Conditions Cancellation Returns Financing Blog Accessibility Statement Privacy Policy </li>\n<div> Get in touch </div>\n<li> +1 (480) 962-9930 Email us </li>\n<div> Follow us </div>\n<li> Instagram Facebook YouTube Twitter Pinterest </li>\n<div> We accept \u00a9 2024 Oak For Less\u00ae Furniture Powered by Shopify </div>\n<div> Gift Card </div>\n<img> Oak For Less\u00ae Furniture </img>\n<img> Oak For Less\u00ae Furniture </img>\n<img> Outdoor </img>",

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). </div>\n<h2> Choose Options </h2>\n<div> this is just a warning Login Shopping Cart 0 items Close Search </div>\n<h3> Trending Now </h3>\n<li> dempus sample magnis loremous saliduar naminos dinterdum </li>\n<h3> Popular Products </h3>\n<div> Vendor:Vendor </div>\n<h3> Example product title </h3>\n<div> Vendor:Vendor </div>\n<h3> Example product title </h3>\n<div> Vendor:Vendor </div>\n<h3> Example product title </h3>\n<div> Menu Sign In Create an Account My Wish List </div>\n<img> Myka Home </img>\n<img> Myka Home </img>\n<img> Myka Home </img>\n<img> Zee Back Cushion </img>\n<img> Zee Back Cushion </img>\n<img> Zee Back Cushion </img>",

A perfect blend of modern country, meets simple nordic functionality. The clean solid lines complement the organic natural curve of the seat, ensuring no two are the same. The hardwood teak is very lightly oiled and sustainably sourced. While the wood is of superior quality, teak naturally allows for knots or slight discolouration. Our design partners hand cut and re-fill knots in the bench top according to Living by Design's specifications. Each of our teak tops vary in this process, and we do not consider these variations to be faults. An ideal bench for the narrow hallway, simple nook, or end of bed. Our extensive size range will ensure a perfect size is available. Our exclusive Sorensen Teak bench with its slender silhouette, is the ideal addition to large or small spaces... indoor or outdoor. </p>\n<p> Material: Solid Teak Warranty: 2 years structural - for more details refer \"WARRANTY\" page below Products Available: 3 x sizes; 100cm + 120cm + 150cm + package price for all 3 benches IndoorOutdoor: Recommended indoor lightly oiled, for outdoor natural greying would occur Care Recommendations: Refer \"PRODUCT CARE + MAINTENANCE\" page below Extra Care Recommendations: Product has been lightly oiled, for extra sealing we recommend Cabot's Cabothane Clear Water Based Interstate Delivery: Yes, delivered assembled Delivery Schedule: 3-7 business days dispatch </p>\n<p> There are three sizes available in the Sorensen teak bench - approximate sizes are : length 100cm 120cm 150cm depth 37cm height 46cm </p>\n<p> FURNITURE SHIPPING : DELIVERY TIMES : In-stock items will be dispatched within 3-7 business days from order via one of our third-party freight partners, tracking details will be supplied where applicable.

We use a protective lacquer finish which enables the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. </p>\n<h2> European oak </h2>\n<p> European oak is a temperate white oak hardwood native to Europe. It presents a golden to light brown hue with a minimal grain pattern. We use a protective white oil finish to allow the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. </p>\n<h2> Dark brown house leather </h2>\n<p> Our house leather is a dark brown aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. </p>\n<h2> Oiled wood </h2>\n<p> An oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best. Day to day cleaning: \u2022 Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture. \u2022 Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible. \u2022 To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out. 6 monthly replenishment more stubborn stains: \u2022 As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces Do not: \u2022 Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain \u2013 wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left) \u2022 Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain. </p>\n<h2> Lacquered wood </h2>\n<p> A lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills. Day to day cleaning: \u2022 Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth. Do not: \u2022 Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain \u2013 wipe up as quickly as possible. \u2022 Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer. </p>\n<h2> House leather </h2>\n<p> Our house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely. Day to day cleaning: \u2022 As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner. Do not: \u2022 Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather. </p>\n<div> Download specification </div>\n<p> This piece is made in Europe \u00a33,550 \u00a33,550 \u00a33,550 \u00a33,550 \u00a33,550 \u00a34,510 \u00a33,550 \u00a33,900 \u00a33,550 \u00a33,550 \u00a33,550 \u00a34,950 Includes VAT.

  "<title> Gloster </title>\n<h1> Teak </h1>\n<div> View all collections Products Search Products Videos Planner Moodboard Blog Catalogue Find Store About Library MENU Teak, crafts and innovation </div>\n<li> Home Materials </li>\n<p> Teak is a close grained hardwood with a high natural oil content. This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour. INDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit. OUTDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. As with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface. Because teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off. If you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection. If you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split. To protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth. </p>\n<h2> Collections Using Teak </h2>\n<div> 180 Accessories Archi Bay Bells Block Blow Bora Carver Coso Cradle Deck Fern Grid Grid Cabana Haven Kasha Kay Lighting Lima Maya Mistral Navigator Omada Raw Saranac Sepal Sway Whirl William Zenith Follow us Gloster Furniture GmbH Tel: +49 4131 28753-0 CONTACT GLOSTER Your region: Rest of WorldPRIVACY STATEMENTABOUT COOKIESIMPRINT </div>\n<img> Gloster </img>\n<img> Gloster </img>\n<img> Facebook </img>\n<img> Instagram </img>\n<img> Pinterest </img>\n<img> Other 1 </img>",

Smooth, clean lines and gentle curves form this modern platform bed, encouraging quiet serenity. This piece bears some semblance to our Sunrise Platform Bed. But the top of the headboard curves into a very subtle concave, as inspired by the roofs in traditional Japanese architecture. The higher headboard enhances support for reading, laptop surfing, or working in bed. Moreover, it\u2019s made of natural hardwood, as is the rest of the platform bed, so sturdy support is guaranteed. A solid wood frame of this caliber is truly one of a kind. It\u2019s made of natural hardwood, which is harvested in Ohio\u2019s managed forests. Plus, it\u2019s finished with our propriety organic finish, produced from all-natural ingredients with zero VOC emissions. This makes the Enso Platform Bed and the rest of T.Y.

It is all 100% natural solid wood in cherry, walnut, oak, and maple. Each wood option is the actual wood species your item will be built using. This gives you a prettier wood grain and a better quality piece of furniture. </p>\n<h3> Finish </h3>\n<p> Every piece is meticulously and sumptuously finished with our signature finishes formulated from non-toxic, all-natural ingredients with zero VOC emissions. This makes our pieces a great option for those looking for organic furniture. </p>\n<h3> Sizes </h3>\n<p> All Enso Beds Have a 12\" Tall Platform and a 44\" tall headboard with 10.25\" clearance under the bed.

A dependable character of the highest sorts, the namesake of the Bertha chair is Bertha Wilson. The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. \u201cWhen she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson \u2013 Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.\u201d The Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view. </div>\n<h2> Fabrication </h2>\n<div> Made using regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople at Fogo Island Workshops. Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request. The cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt\u2019s Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests. </div>\n<h2> Bertha Chair </h2>\n<div> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
