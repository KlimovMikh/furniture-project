It was Walter Cox himself who started the business as a watch maker in 1918 after he'd served in the First World War, the shop was originally based in Church Street then moved to the current site on Welbeck Road in 1935. Douglas Cox took over from him followed by David Cox, Walter's sons. David and his wife, Kathleen, retired 16 years ago and now Samantha, their daughter, and her husband John, run the shop. Over the years the shop has sold many different products including paint, prams, clothes and shoes. Long before Netflix and Firesticks, you could forget about Blockbusters, Walter Cox was the place to go for all your rental videos. Through the years the shop has changed what it sells to keep up with current trends and fashions, one thing that has not changed is the pride we take in our customer service to all our existing and new customers. Today the shop sells a wide range of household furniture, beds, carpets and household electricals from leading brands such as Hotpoint, Indesit, Whirlpool, Lifestyle Floors, Dura Beds and Julian Bowen."

For us detail, quality of material and engineering precision is key in this line. SOHO HOOK is a sophisticated, minimalist hook designed to hold your jacket, coat, robe, towel, apron, or any home object that needs to be hung or displayed with a little style. For use in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, reception, retail and commercial spaces. The hook is a 2 piece construction with a base and a cap. The base is screwed into a wall, door or cabinet with a supplied counter sunk square head screw. The cap threads onto the base to hide the screw. The grooved edge detailing is more than aesthetic, its purpose is to provide extra grip for items that would be draped over the edge."

        "content": "In 1972 the Aarnios lived in Tontunm√§ki, where Eero utilized their garage as his work space. Although his previous pieces had already possessed uniqueness and characteristics, Eero describes Pony as his first very unusual design. He thought about chairs. One can sit almost anywhere. A seat doesn‚Äôt even have to be a chair or a sofa. One can sit on the stairs, on a rock, on a tree stump, on a horse, on a pony‚Ä¶ He decided to design a soft animal figure, which you could sit on, like riding a horse. In 1973 the first sketch of the Pony was sent to Asko Furniture company, who was the main producer of Eero Aarnio‚Äôs designs. They completed the basic form for the seat and sent it by bus to Puumala, where Eero continued developing the prototype at the Aarnio family‚Äôs summer cottage. Eero thought the first mold was decent but needed enhancing. In the country side, there was plenty of space to work, and since the body was made of polystyrene, he didn‚Äôt mind getting his hands and surroundings all over it. Eero bought some modeling clay and worked further with the body. After the basic form was finished, he painted the first Pony white. From the start Eero knew the Pony needed upholstering. The process for the upholsterer is extremely challenging and difficult, requiring rare talent in hand crafting. As a result, one can only admire the magnificent seaming, intertwining together with the form of the body and flexibility of the fabric. However, some Ponys out there do not have their ‚Äòfurs‚Äô. Batches has been produced of concrete to serve as road blocks. Ponys made of concrete are not easily moved around, since they weigh as much as 250kg. Eero Aarnio‚Äôs Pony is no regular chair. The designer himself prefers to rather call it a seat. Eero designed the Pony first and foremost to provide a comfortable form. The size came out of ergonomics, it is the perfect height for back and feet to rest. One can ride it or sit sideways on it. Eero initially designed the smaller size for children, however, the young have always been as keen on to climb on the larger Pony. It looks like a child‚Äôs oversized toy, even though the dimensions are designed for adults. ‚ÄúWe are all big kids, of course‚Äù, says Eero Aarnio. Pony is often referred to as intriguing the inner child in adults. Eero‚Äôs design aesthetics have a certain playfulness and humor, which have been very salient in his creativity and thinking process. Eero believes certain pieces should have a certain personality, one that suits them perfectly. For example, color is a key part of the message and a way of communicating for Eero. For the Pony, Eero prefers the colors green and white. Although, speaking from experience, for a family with children, white can be quite sensitive‚Ä¶"

For full information and tips on this visit . Stained wood can be easily maintained with Furniture Wax, which enhances the natural beauty of the wood and nourishes and protects the piece. Dust wood with a soft, dry cloth. Do not use harsh care products that contain ammonia or silicone as this will cut through the finish over time and damage your piece. Use coasters, trivets and felt pads under objects to protect the finish of your piece. Never place hot dishes on surfaces - the use of felt-backed table mats is recommended. Spills should be removed immediately with a cloth. Always avoid exposure to direct sunlight or heat as this can cause cracking and potential fading; a minimum of 12 inches clearance from heat sources is advised. Do not drag piece across the floor as this will cause damage or weaken joints. Dropping furniture onto corners or feet will cause damage. Toys, buckles and heels will scratch furnishings‚Äîprevent these items from touching your piece when possible."

If your room is swimming in white oak, this collection is here to spice things up with bold oak strip panels and soft-closing doors that reveal a sleek black interior‚Äîbecause why should the outside have all the fun? On the flip side, are you looking for something more subtle? The Linea also comes in all-natural oak or all-black oak for those who prefer their drama with a side of calm. Either way, your space is about to get a whole lot more interesting! Dimensions: W159 D45 H76.1CM The Timber Wood displays different grain patterns depending on which way they are cut - for example, the 'medullary ray' which can appear on oak furniture is a mark of good quality timber, these are just characteristics of the natural beauty of the wood. Wood veneers also allow distinctive patterns to be created on some surfaces, such as table tops and drawer fronts by the way slivers are arranged. All timber and veneer surfaces will change colour and mellow over time. New furniture will initially vary in shade from items that have been previously purchased. Freight Prices Below is the typical freight price to large towns and Cities in NZ except rural. All North Island including Auckland deliveries - $145 Wellington - free pick-up, (choose \"EMAIL bestfurniture@xtra.co.nz FOR A SHIPPING QUOTE\" at checkout). Christchurch - $60 (or free pick-up) South Island Cities or large towns - $75 This should come up at check-out, but if your address doesn't please email us on team@bestfurniture.co.nz and we will get you a quote."

Over 30 years ago our founder Matthias traveled through South America in a canoe, sleeping in a hammock he made with the help of the Huaorani Indian tribe. It transformed his experience and gave him the rest he needed to travel through the dense rainforest, and avoid being bitten by the many critters that roamed the forest floors. Returning to Germany he began to sell hammocks to his friends and family. Eventually, demand grew and now Amazonas is recognised as one of the best manufacturers of hammocks in the world with factories in South America and around Europe. All our hammocks are now made by skilled experts using only the best materials, which is why we are the only hammock manufacturer to carry the GS Quality and TUV Safety marks, which recognise the exceptional safety and quality of what we do."

The Molloy collection is available in a variety of timber finishes."

A firm believer that every environment is defined by the objects within it, Adam Goodrum designs with the philosophy that an object must therefore justify its existence ‚Äì through its story and detailing. For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftsmanship, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality. In recent years, Goodrum‚Äôs work has been awarded a host of design accolades including the NGV Rigg Prize, Vogue x Alessi Design Prize, Indesign Luminary Award and the Idea Awards Editor‚Äôs Medal. He has also been commissioned to design pieces for several global luxury brands including Veuve Clicquot, Alessi and Cappellini."

It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment. The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels. Thoughtful detailing enhances the simple design of this Lostine collection. Each thick leather seat has its own character and variations lending to the appeal of the material. The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA."

We‚Äôre an Australian family-owned business that designs and manufactures our own designer furniture, then delivers it nationwide. Here at our store, there are two main styles of furniture design: mid-century modern and contemporary. Mid-century style is characterised by its clean lines, simple forms, and natural materials. Contemporary furniture, on the other hand, is more often defined by its use of bold colours, patterns, and artwork, as well as cutting-edge materials. We celebrate both of these here at Modern Furniture. We travel the world looking for beautiful decor, with a range of timeless pieces crafted from quality materials.

        "content": "Teak is a close grained hardwood with a high natural oil content. This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour. INDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit. OUTDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. As with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface. Because teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off. If you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection. If you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split. To protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth."

Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied.

We will contact you when it's ready so that we can arrange a convenient delivery day. Large items will be delivered using a courier service who can bring it in to a room of choice. Very large, heavy items will be delivered by a 2-person courier team if this service is available to your postcode. Courier delivery unfortunately isn't available to Northern Ireland, some remote postcodes in Wales, Scotland and England or any offshore addresses. For areas not covered by our courier we can package your order on a pallet and ship it with a parcel service. This will incur a surcharge starting at ¬£40 for smaller furniture items. This will be automatically calculated at checkout for Northern Ireland. Please call or send us a message if you want to discuss delivery options to your postcode. Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple wooden sections). We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes. We can also arrange assembly and removal of packaging using a white glove service that will do all the heavy lifting for you. This usually costs ¬£35. Please remember to provide a contact telephone number at checkout. All couriers require this and without it, we can't send your furniture!"

Staff specifically Claudia has been great at answering all our questions and going through all our concerns patiently. Would definitely recommend buying here. Sree V I recently had the pleasure of shopping at Euro Living, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm smile and a sense of tranquility in their beautifully designed store. The selection of furniture and home decor was not only extensive but also of remarkable quality. What truly set Euro Living apart was their customer service. Edyd was incredibly knowledgeable and went above and beyond to help me find the perfect pieces to complement my home. Their personalized recommendations made the process so much easier. Lisa Martinez Love the selection they have and Scott was very helpful in assisting us. He was great at responding to my questions and keeping me updated on the status of my order. Their delivery team did a wonderful job and we're so helpful while setting up the entire room. I highly recommend this store if you're looking for quality and great customer service! Zeny Patel We live in San Antonio and found the perfect rug for our home. The staff was easy to work with and helped us make sure we found the correct size. Scott Nguyen made everything go so smoothly. I recommend you check out this store if you are a lover of contemporary furnishings. Susan Wampler This is the perfect store to get everything you need for your home. Beautiful high quality furnitures. Edyd is professional, passionate and sweet so ask for her help. Highly recommended! Love Sasson"

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."

Firstly, use the ottoman as a footrest or chair for your small space desk or even coffee/dining table. Secondly, when it's time for a get-together, remove the lid and slide out four additional stools. Subsequently, remove the sides of the cube ottoman and attach them easily to the stool tops - voila! Seating is cushioned, with a PU material, so it's easy to clean. Available in black or grey, so pick the colour that suits your decor."

The light you choose has a significant effect on the ambience and character of your room, and make a big difference in making it a functional and comfortable space. Creating the perfect light in a room is far from an easy task. Combine various light sources and use wall lamps, pendants, floor and table lamps to create layered lighting and make a functional light scape that adds beauty to overall design schemes. The perfect living room lighting provides an overall warming illumination while also adding a functional light for reading and a discreet soothing light for relaxation. Invite floor and table lamps into your d√©cor for where extra light is needed and let pendants add sculptural expressions to your living room, hallway or dining room. Our collection of lamps range from sculptural eye-catching pendants, classic and timeless ceiling lamps, to playful wall lamps and table lamps with nostalgic expressions. We strive to create inviting and edifying lighting atmospheres that make you feel at home and at ease, wherever you are."

Dalam kesempatan ini bisa dimanfaatkan sebagai tambahan modal untuk bermain lebih lama. Ketika kekalahan di peroleh cukup sering, sebaiknya segera turunkan nilai taruhan untuk mengantisipasi peluang kerugian yang tidak dapat di prediksi. Apabila kondisi permainan sudah stabil, tentunya pemasangan taruhan bisa kembali di lakukan dengan nilai tinggi."

The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. ‚ÄúWhen she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson ‚Äì Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.‚Äù The Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view."

Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request. The cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt‚Äôs Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests."

Spills should be absorbed with a dry cloth, then spot cleaned with mild soap and water. It‚Äôs normal for loose ends to show up from time to time with any area rug, however it‚Äôs important to snip them with a scissor immediately - pulling on loose ends by hand is harmful to the strength of your rug. Rug tolerances can vary by +/- 3 inches in relation to the advertised size. A non-skid pad is recommended to prevent slippage. Since rugs are rolled for shipping, occasionally they may crease during transit. All creases will disappear within 2 weeks after the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling will help flatten out creases promptly."

If your item is in stock (quantity of 1+ on our website), your piece will be dispatched within 2 weeks. In usual times, if your item is not in stock currently or is on the way, you could receive your items within 2-14 weeks however with these new delays we're experiencing since the beginning of Covid-19, we expect you to receive your items within 2-18 weeks. As mentioned on our product pages, please kindly contact us if you would like to check availability, or how far your desired piece/s is from arriving into our Melbourne or Sydney warehouse. Our aim is to deliver the best possible service to our lovely customers, and we will ensure to keep all customers updated on the status of purchased items. In order for a smooth delivery process, please provide a suitable delivery address and contact number where deliveries can be made during business hours (Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm). We will not post to PO post office addresses. If we foresee any delays, you will be notified via email or phone. Can I give my authority to leave the items at the time of delivery? If you wish to provide Mahlia‚Äôs carriers with the authority to leave your items when being delivered, please provide any authority to leave delivery instructions during the order checkout process. This will give the carriers the authority for your items to be left at the front door or another safe spot. Please note that we do not take any responsibility for loss or damage of your items in which we have been given an authority to leave. We recommend you track your items where necessary to avoid this. If you have given the authority to leave your items, a signature is not required. What if I missed my delivery, or the carrier was given limited delivery access? If a delivery is missed, you may be required to arrange re-delivery that takes additional time and may incur an additional cost (with the carrier). For smaller deliveries, if your delivery is missed, a card will be left in your letterbox to arrange a pick-up or redelivery. If there is difficult or restricted access to the delivery address, such as a high-rise apartment block or up and down stairs, please notify us at the time of purchase. Where this may occur, there may be additional shipping charges applied to your order. Please give clear instructions for delivery at checkout when purchasing items. All orders require a signature when delivered. If you have given the authority to leave your items, a signature is not required. Do you ship internationally? We‚Äôd love to help the best we can, so please contact us via email at if you are located outside of Australia and wish to purchase an item. We may be able to ship to your location, and will confirm this via email. Can I cancel my order once purchased? We must be contacted within 4 hour of purchase, if you would like to cancel your order. Cancellations of orders are not permitted if an order has been placed with our supplier or if the item has been dispatched. If we're notified within the 4 hour window, we are happy to refund the amount, less the processing fee's charged through our payment systems. If we are notified after 4 hours, you'll be offered store credit for the amount paid - whether this be for the full amount of a deposit payment. For any custom orders, these cannot be refunded and you cannot receive a store credit for these. Can I return my purchased items once they‚Äôve arrived? Mahlia Interiors will not offer returns on ‚Äòchange of mind‚Äô purchases. We will offer a credit note, and the return shipping will be at your own cost. The credit amount for ‚Äòchange of mind‚Äô returns will be equal to your purchased order cost less the return shipping cost. You are fully responsible for paying for the return shipping of your item. If you have any questions on returns, please email us at . All return items are your responsibility, and must be returned in the same condition they were sent; unused and in re-saleable and original condition. These returned items must be in the original packaging and care must be taken re-packing the items to avoid any damage during the transit process.

After some time of owning your inlay piece, if the shine comes off slightly then please apply a small amount of coconut oil and white wax and clean it with a dry cloth. Bone and mother of pearl inlay furniture has a porous surface, so items in high-use situations - such as coffee tables - should be sealed prior to use. Grout or polyurethane sealant (available from any hardware store) is suitable for this - example: Whilst this sealant is clear, when you are sealing your piece, we recommend using a very soft cloth in a circular motion (rather than a paint brush) in order to avoid any potential brush strokes left on your piece. Please do not use regular cleaning products (surface cleaners, glass cleaners) to care for bone inlay. They are very harsh to use on inlay pieces. If your piece is under direct and constant sunlight, the bone pieces may have the potential to turn a slightly yellow tone over time, and little exposure to sunlight can be useful to help them stay light for a longer duration. Please be careful that you don't put your inlay piece under extreme heat or directly under the sun. If your inlay products may be used often (tray, drawers for example), the bone pieces may fall from edges during the use. The wood and bone both are naturally contracting and expanding materials but not at the same pace, so during season/weather change this could happen. Please use all-fix or super glue available locally to easily fix yourself if this may happen."

When the larger furniture crate arrives at your home, you will require two tools to open the crate. This includes a crow bar and hammer, or as a third additional option you can use a cordless drill with Phillips head attachment (or a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the screws is a perfectly fine alternative).

Just recently we needed an adjustable bed after my mom‚Äôs injury and we needed ASAP to be able to bring her mom from the hospital. As always Charlie made it happen! Great store and great employees!!!! Caryl H. I have shopped at Wayne‚Äôs Furniture for years and always had a Great experience. Charlie is the greatest salesman and very honest about his knowledge in furniture. When something goes wrong with the furniture like the switches on the couch or chair he always sends Mike who is very Knowledgeable and fixes it instead of buying new furniture. Charlie is trustworthy and makes sure his customers are happy with the service provided. GREAT job Charlie keep up the good work!!!! Tammy B. I found there is a great reason why Wayne's Fine Furniture has been around for so long - it's their great knowledge of the furniture industry, ability to navigate the current logistical challenges, and awesome customer service that puts Wayne's above its competitors. Charlie was a true partner through the process, helping to troubleshoot when my furniture was held up in transit. I would definitely recommend Wayne's!! Susanne K. By far one of the most positive experiences you can get at a furniture store, Charlie goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied even a year after the sale was done. That‚Äôs the type of service and commitment you just see less and less of these days. Would highly recommend for your next furniture purchase! Also the prices and quality are unmatched. Nick K. My husband and I bought our very first home a couple months back so we decided to furnish our new home. We shopped and shopped until we came across this mom and pop store Wayne‚Äôs Furniture. We went in and furnished the master bedroom as well as my youngest sons room. Charlie is great! Super customer friendly savvy, fast delivery. I LOVE my bed and anyone who tours my home comments on my bed! My sons first time in his own room and he was too excited to start decorating! Thanks again Wayne‚Äôs Furniture- check them out. 5/5 stars for me Shaura H. I was first introduced to Wayne‚Äôs furniture by my brother. Who only makes recommendations if he knows the company or person is reputable. Needless to say, Charlie and his staff did not disappoint. Even, with uncontrollable delivery delays they kept us updated on every step of the way. If you want quality furniture and good service use Waynes!!! Jackie B."

As we worked on the Bianca Forest project, this table caught our attention as a remarkable addition. I am genuinely astounded to discover a high-end product that offers exceptional value for its price. It perfectly aligns with our vision of delivering top-notch design without compromising on quality or affordability. Natasha O. Reviewing The Mikael Queen Bed I was thrilled to receive my Hoft Home queen bed just three days after ordering. The wood quality is top-notch, exuding a rich and elegant feel. The accompanying fabric is soft and luxurious, enhancing the overall aesthetic. What's more, assembly was a breeze, taking a mere ten minutes with clear instructions. This bed isn't just furniture; it's a statement of luxury and comfort. Highly recommended! Tasha P. Reviewing The Jan Sectional Beyond comfortable \u0026 beautiful. The wood base is a perfect finish the cushions are super plush and comfortable and the fabric is extremely soft, highly recommend! Joy L. Reviewing The Emery Dining Chair The wood quality is fantastic, and the style is such a beautiufl take on mid-century design. The overall comfort is great Tasha M.

Reviewing The Zola Dining Chair As a professional designer at Fancy Interiors Studio, I take pride in selecting top-tier products that exude excellence in quality, showcase exquisite designs, and align with our clients' budget. These chairs have not only impressed us but also received very positive feedback from our clients. Megan P Reviewing The Werner Extendable Dining Table What an amazing experience. The customer service staff were available to help at all points in the process. The Werner table is stunning. Thank you Hoft Home. Ty F. Reviewing The Carter Counter Stool So unbelievably beautiful the upholstery is super high quality, and so is the wood. Highly recommend they arrive fast. Adam L Reviewing The Zaki Counter Stool These weren't exactly what I was looking for, but I am happy I came across them! I was looking for a traditional-looking stool, but I was very intrigued by these when I cam across them on the site. The design is unique, and I thought it would certainly stand out amongst my other furniture pieces. Safe to say I made the right choice as these stools are not only a pleasure to look at but also quite comfortable. Alison B. Reviewing The Mikael Nightstand Amazing! The quality and deign is great and I really like the open drawer for easy access for my books before bed. Dany L. Reviewing The Emery Dining Chair Timeless design they are comfortable and built well!"

Day to day cleaning: ‚Ä¢ Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture. ‚Ä¢ Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible. ‚Ä¢ To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash \u0026 Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out. 6 monthly replenishment / more stubborn stains: ‚Ä¢ As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces Do not: ‚Ä¢ Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain ‚Äì wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left) ‚Ä¢ Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain."

These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely. Day to day cleaning: ‚Ä¢ As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner. Do not: ‚Ä¢ Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather."

The clean solid lines complement the organic natural curve of the seat, ensuring no two are the same. The hardwood teak is very lightly oiled and sustainably sourced. While the wood is of superior quality, teak naturally allows for knots or slight discolouration. Our design partners hand cut and re-fill knots in the bench top according to Living by Design's specifications. Each of our teak tops vary in this process, and we do not consider these variations to be faults. An ideal bench for the narrow hallway, simple nook, or end of bed. Our extensive size range will ensure a perfect size is available. Our exclusive Sorensen Teak bench with its slender silhouette, is the ideal addition to large or small spaces... indoor or outdoor."
